  <h2 class="simple">On Ruby on Rails</h2>

  <section>
    <p>
    By now we are all fairly familiar with Ruby, but few of us may actually have an idea of how it can be used to develop websites. Ruby alone is not enough to do so, we need Rails. Rails is a software library that extends the Ruby and it was created by David Heinemeier. Rails it's technically a package library and it is installed useing the command-line.
    </p>
    <p>
    Rails can be thought of as a framework for building websites and as such, it establishes conventions to make collaboration and maintenance easier.   
    <p>
    <p> 
     Rails combines Ruby with HTML, CSS and JS to create an application that can run on a web server, this makes Rails a "back-end" web application development platform. 
    </p>
    <p>
      What makes Rails so popular (among the top ten languages most widely used) is that due to its relatively easy yet powerful nature its has develop a very active online community that continously seek to simplify the task of building complex websites. Members of the Rails community are very supportive and you can find detailed blogs, books and documents on Rails application programming interface (API) for free online. Also, its open source libraries, known as RubyGems, makes it possible to build complex websites fairly quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The way I understand it, Rails the medium through which Ruby is adapted to web development, "hence Ruby on Rails" as named by Heinemeier, as Ruby is actually a general purpose language but used mostly for web development due to Rails popularity.
