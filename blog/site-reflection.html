    <p>
    It's been quite a fun challenge so far to build this site. I am happy with my current capacity to understand HTML although I certainly could improve in some aspects, especially positioning. Looking back I very much like my original idea of having my home page a music library as I think it look very cool and I think it appeals to lot of people, at least I know that I like it when a site introduces me to new music. I look foward to expandin this idea and possibly adding effects to it with JQuery. I look foward to my time in San Diego, and seeing what I will me capable of doing at the end of the course.
