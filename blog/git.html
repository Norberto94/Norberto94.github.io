      Version control is useful for when you're working solo or in a group. It allows you to work on a proyect without affecting the "real" version, until you're 100% sure that the progress you've made is worthy of becoming permanent. It also lets you go back to an earlier version of your work in case something goes wrong.

         One of the most popular version control softwares is "git". In git there's the concept of saving a "commit", which can be thought of as a milestone in a body of work. Much like in microsoft you can undo the previous action, git allows you to checkout previous version of a work before or after a given commit. Unlike microsoft word, the user chooses what is considered a milestone, or saving point, rather that it being individual keys or actions. There are good reasons to use Github, a social network for git users. It is very popular, giving access to a broad body or work and communication with other developers, it has a neat UI (once you get the hang of it), and it can be accessed directly from your terminal and your work will be sotred remotely. Github has the concept of "branching off" from the "master" version of a document and then "merging" the branch with the master. This is useful when working solo to make sure that you don't accidentally erase something and lose it forever and to keep track of your progress; it is also useful when sharing your work because others can go thtough your commits and understand your work better. Branching and merging is even more useful when working in groups because it allows everyone to work on their own version of a shared work and only when ready and with the approval of others will the changes made me merged in the shared version.

        At first I struggled a bit with the git workflow, but I am starting to get the hang of it. When working on challenge 1.6 it finnaly seemed to "click", at least to a higher degree of understanding. I look foward to learning more about git and Github as it is clearly an important aspect of a developer's work.
