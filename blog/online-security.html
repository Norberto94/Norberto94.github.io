    One of the biggest problems the tech world has to deal with is fraud. There are many types of fraud but I chose to focus on online financial fraud. The most common way a thief can steal your credit card information or even your bank account information is by using malware. Malware is a term used to describe software that allows a hacker to extract information from a user's computer. The common way hackers try to get your computer infected is via the use of some sort of bait. The bait could be an email or website that when opened will make your computer download the malware without letting the user know.

         Over 70 million people where victims of credit card theft in 2014 and about 30 million where in the U.S. The U.S. has the highest rate of credit card fraud in the world.

       Let's assume that a hacker got a hold of your credit card, this wouldn't be a problem if everywhere he/she went, either online or to some physical store, if they needed to prove that they really are the owner of the card. Most physical businesses will ask for an ID but a skilled hacker can probably also make a good fake ID. But when it comes to an online transaction there's nothing they need to have besides the info on the card to use it. The solution I propose is yet to be possible but it may be the way we eventually mitigate credit card fraud. As technology advances certain features are more and more commonplace in all sorts of devices, and I picture a future where a fingerprint reader is in all smartphones and keyboards. If fingerprint readers become default in all devices online and on-site transactions will surely include it in the purchase process. This new step in user identification will make it much more difficult for someone to be able to use your stolen credit card number. We can go even further and imagine a future where eye scans are default in all devices making user identification even more difficult to fake.</p>
