  <h2 class="simple">On margin, border, and padding</h2>

  <section>

     With CSS we get to play around with three different aspects of an element that at first glance may seem interchangeable. Let's take a closer look and see why they are not.

    <p>
         First, we have to know what is it that has a border, a margin and padding, and that thing is the content. The content is simply where text and images will appear and it has a default box around it that defines its limits. We can manipulate the size of this box with the commands "padding" and "margin". They are not interchangeable though, padding refers to the space between the border and the content, and margin refers to the space outside the border. That's basically the only difference between them. Finally, the command "border" creates a visible outline around the padding.

        Like with many other thing is CSS we have access to more specific manipulation of these three things, besides it size. For example, we can change their colors, width and height as separate values and thickness. Being knowledgeable with these parts of an element is iseful to create boxes and move things around and have them be as apart or close together as you like.</p>
