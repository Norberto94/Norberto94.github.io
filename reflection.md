What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

The way I formatted my site did not regquire me to change neither the border or kargin of an element, but I understand what they mean. I gave a text some padding in order to box it.

What did you learn about CSS positioning?

I learned how useful it is to center stuff. I thought I was going to need to use float and/or other positioning commands but the images on my home page fit nicely without it.

What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

I had to to a bit or research for a few things but in hindsight it all seemed fairly simple. I think what limited me mostly was my lack of ideas but the faily simple things I wanted to do I knew how without much trouble.

What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

I understood why they say that it is best to have a separate file for formatting. It would be a real mess to have on the html file and having a separate file also allows you to interchange styles quickly.
