It will take you to a page where you will add a title and configure some aspects of your new repository (wheather you want it public or private for example).

To clone your repo down to your computer simply type "git clone" followed my a space and your repo's name.

Describe what open source means.

Open source means that the code for a sowfware is available for free for anyone to see.

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
Assess the importance of using licenses.

I think it is an awesome concept. I don't know much about things people have accomplished with open source but I can imagine a proyect can benefit from people all over the world contributing something to it, assuming that there's is a screening procedure to what it is allowed to be merged with the public document. I can see myself checking out some open source proyects and modifying programs to my liking when I am crafty enough to do so.

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

The workflow of adding a file to the stage, commiting, pushing and merging. I was having a problem getting to the directory I needed to, and this shook up the confidence I had gained regarding my ability with the terminal, only to find during office hours of the silliest mistake I was making that didn't allow me to get to the directory I wanted. I had two folders with the same name one inside of the other, so I simply have to "cd" one more time to get to it. I feel like the basic git workflow finally clicked for me during this challenge.
